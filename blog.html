                Scope of Var, Let and Const

                The scope of a var variable is functional scope. It can be
                updated and re-declared into the scope, can be declared without
                initialization, can be accessed without initialization as its
                default value is “undefined”, hoisting done, with initializing
                as ‘default’ value.

              <p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
                <span class="font-bold">Let <br /></span>
                The scope of a let variable is block scope. It can be updated
                but cannot be re-declared into the scope, can be declared
                without initialization, It cannot be accessed without
                initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’, Hoisting
                is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for the error
                when we access the let variable before
                declaration/initialization).

              <p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">

                The scope of a const variable is block scope, It cannot be
                updated or re-declared into the scope, cannot be declared
                without initialization, cannot be accessed without
                initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization,
                Hoisting is done, but not initialized.

                Use cases of Null and Undefined
              </h2>

            <div class="lg:w-1/2">
              <p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
                <span class="font-bold">What is Null? <br /></span>
                Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The
                variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. When
                we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is
                empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value.
                Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to
                a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value
                must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never sets the
                value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
                <span class="font-bold">What is Undefined? <br /></span>
                As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we
                declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable
                becomes undefined. Unlike null, the value of an undefined
                variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets
                created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a
                function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined.
                Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns
                undefined.

                What is REST APIs?
              </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="lg:w-1/2">
              <p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
                A REST API is a way of easily accessing web services. When a
                RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a
                representation of the state of the requested resource. A RESTful
                API is stateless, separates concerns between client-server,
                allows caching of data client-side and it utilizes standardized
                base URLs and methods to perform the actions required to
                manipulate, add or delete data.
                <br />
                REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and
                flexible way without having any processing. REST technology is
                generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access
                Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth,
                simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage.
                It’s used to fetch or give some information from a web service.
                All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.
